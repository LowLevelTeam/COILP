* @brief The public interface for utilizing the COIL processor.
*
* The COIL processor is split between the executable CLI program for compilation/processing/assembling of .coil files
* into a native object.
*
* The libcop-dev library which is built by this program can be linked against for progatamic compilation.
*
* This compilation structure is way faster and easier to implement for C compilers that want to handle all stages of
* the compilation process
