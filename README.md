## Overview

COILP is the processor component of the COIL (Computer Oriented Intermediate Language) Toolchain. It translates COIL binary format into target-specific machine code, allowing programs written in COIL to execute natively on different architectures.

COILP serves as the middle stage of the COIL compilation process, bridging the gap between optionally architecture-independent COIL code and architecture-specific executables.
